# class_rank
This is a deploy branch and the requirement.txt is not all needed

REMAINDER: result is for reference only. More could be improved

This is a class ranking filter on [classu](http://classutil.unsw.edu.au/COMP_T1.html)  
Method used is inefficient (not multithread on getting url)

deploy on heroku app (it says 18/24 hrs on for free tier)
